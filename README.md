# History - 
Data products are integral part of telecom business and as we are gradually moving into a digital world and constantly changing subscriber behaviour and usage pattern, frequent change, modification and new product development request used to come. With repitive cycle of configuring these products in system by hand became increasingly difficult task to deliver and prepare for market before deadlines. So I've come up with a solution - 
1. That will take business logics into a HTML form then create a simple excel file out of it.
2. The excel then put into a shared directory from where my python script can read the file and execute.
3. Then propelled with selenium's powerful UI automation APIs, create data packs iteratively and provide 10x faster configuration than before.
